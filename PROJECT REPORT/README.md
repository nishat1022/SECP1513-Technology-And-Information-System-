# Project Report  
## UTM Digital Campus Security & Emergency Safety Response System

This project was developed as part of the **Design Thinking Project** for the  
**Technology and Information System (SECP1513)** course, Semester I (2025/2026).

## 📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to design a **UTM Digital Campus Security and Emergency Safety Response System** that provides a centralized, user-friendly platform for reporting emergencies and accessing safety information on campus. The system addresses common issues such as lack of awareness of emergency procedures, slow reporting processes, and communication delays during critical situations.

The project applies the **Design Thinking methodology**, focusing on user needs through the following phases:
- Empathy  
- Define  
- Ideate  
- Prototype  
- Testing  

A **non-functional prototype** was developed to demonstrate the interface design, key features, and user flow without backend implementation.

## 🛠 Key Features Proposed
- One-tap **SOS Emergency Alert** system  
- Centralized emergency contact information  
- Emergency reporting with location details  
- Real-time emergency notifications  
- Clear emergency guidelines and instructions  

These features aim to improve response time, reduce confusion, and enhance campus safety and well-being.
